        Withdrawing from a Traditional IRA is a taxable event.
        You will pay tax on the amount withdrawn as income.
      </li>
      <li>
        Withdrawing from a Roth IRA is a non-taxable event if
        it occurs at least 5 years after your first Roth IRA contribution.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a penalty of 10% in addition to the regular taxes
        you will pay if you withdraw funds from your IRA before age 59 1/2.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are required to take distributions from your Traditional IRA starting at age 70 1/2.
        These are called Required Minimum Distributions (or RMDâ€™s).
